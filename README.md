# My-Python-Projects
My All Python Projects
From basics to my Professional process about my Python learns.
AI support was used when necessary.
Especially in the Tkinter section.
In addition, a trial and error learning technique was used completely from 1 example without watching any videos.
In addition, we had a game project that we once did on Roblox.
We abandoned it after a 2-year process and as a result, I focused on Python training and learned all of these thanks to the 1-month process and Roblox Lua.
Note:I'm continue to learn Python.
